## Overview

I Tried to recreate the design of the card simply using CSS properties and media queries for the Mobile design. I'm sure that the proprtion are a bit different from the original design but I'm  trying to working on it.

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### Continued development

I want to fix a bit the design for both the Mobile and Desktop design. I would like in the future to redo this challenge by using some frameorks maybe (Angular or React maybe). I just wanted to test my CSS skills with this first challenge. I always sucked with CSS, but I want to improve my front-end skills.
